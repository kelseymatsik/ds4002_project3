# Classifying Cancerous Brain Tumors 
This file contains relevant output for our final convolutional neural network (CNN) model which aims to classify brain tumor type (meningioma, glioma, or pituitary) based on image data.


## Model Accuracy over Epochs 
This figure visualizes model accuracy over epochs. Our model achieved the highest accuracy on the validation set on the 13th epoch of 91.3%.

## Model Evaluation Metrics 
Overall, our final CNN model achieved 91.3% accuracy, 90.0% recall, and 90.0% precision. Glioma was the most difficult type of brain tumor to correctly predict and identify, while pituitary was the easiest. This has important implications in brain cancer research and treatment fields, as glioma tumors are typically more invasive and faster-growing, while pituitary tumors are typically less invasive and slower-growing.
